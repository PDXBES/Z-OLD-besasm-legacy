This file documents the changes made to the files in the
\SWMM\SWMM42\PDXTRAN directory.

BD.INC
  Changed ANORM, TWNORM, and HRNORM array sizes to 30 (hard-coded
  does not use LASTCP--see PDXTRN.INC)

BLKDATA.FOR
  Added data blocks for shapes 16-20 as well as placeholders for
  shapes 6-15 and 21-30.

CDSUB.FOR
  Fixed call to ENDOFF, which does not require arguments.

DEPTHX.FOR
  Changed various IF switches that referred to shape classes < 8 and
  < 5 to include shapes >= 13.

FLDETM.FOR
FRECAL.FOR
  Same as CDSUB.FOR

HEAD.FOR
  Changed IF switches referring to shapes <= 9 to include shapes >=
  13. 

HYDRAD.FOR
  Same as DEPTHX.FOR.

INDAT11P.FOR
  Consolidated the pdx_## variables into the pdxcp array, which is
  used to check for repeat definitions of custom shapes.

  Added the variable pdxar for use in accessing the pdx_ca,
  pdx_cr, and pdx_cw arrays.

  Dimensions for pdx_ca, pdx_cr, and pdx_cw arrays changed from
  hard-coded '3' to constant NUM_CP defined in PDXTRN.INC.

  Increased dimension for CTYPE to LASTCP elements.  CTYPE holds
  strings describing the type of pipe.

  Added data blocks for pdxsha, pdxshr, and pdxshw, which contain
  coefficients for shapes 16-20.

  Changed initialization of pdx_## variables to pdxcp array.

  Changed initialization of pdx_ca, pdx_cr, and pdx_cw arrays from
  hard-coded '3' to constant NUM_CP.

  Changed various switches so types 13-30 are covered.

  Removed flags pdx_3, pdx_4, and pdx_5 since they are no longer
  necessary.  They are not used in the pdxcp array.  Types 3, 4,
  and 5 can now coexist with types 13, 14, and 15.

  Added code to calculate AFULL, RFULL, and WIDE for shapes 16-20.
  Changed error messages for trapping illegal user-defined shape
  definitions.

  Added code for variable pdxar to map shape numbers as follows
  for use with the pdx_ca, pdx_cr, and pdx_cw arrays:
    13-15  ->  1-3
    21-30  ->  4-13

  Removed trap for checking coexistence of types 3-5 and 13-15.

INDAT12P.FOR
  Changed IF switch to exclude shapes >= 13.

  Added statement to force usage of default diurnal curve if D1
  card ha no coordinates or land use code (i.e., it's a standard
  D1 card)

MAINEXT.FOR
  Added comments for use with Fortran Powerstation.

  Added trap for identical input & output filenames.

OUTPUT.FOR
  Fixed call to RGOUT, which only requires one parameter, not two.

PDXTRN.INC
  Added the constants NUM_CP and LASTCP

RGFREE.FOR
RGSUB.FOR
SUBCAL.FOR
  Same as CDSUB.FOR

TRANSXPX.FOR
  Changed switch so that shape 5 is not included in a calculation.

  Added wrote statements for screen output.

XROUTE.FOR
  Changed IF switches to exclude shapes >= 13 as well as other IF
  switches to include shapes >= 13.
