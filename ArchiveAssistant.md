# Introduction #

The Archive Assistant allows you to navigate your computer (including mapped drives) and assess directories with the largest sizes and the oldest "touch" dates.  The calculations take into account file sizes (but not actual disk space), as well as figures out, file by file, what the most recent touch date is for the directory.  It does not use the modify date for the directory in determining this.
